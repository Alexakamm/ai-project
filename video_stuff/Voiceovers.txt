What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is all about teaching computers to understand and respond to human language.
It's like helping machines get the gist of what we're saying, whether it's through text or voice. 
NLP uses cool tech from AI and linguistics to do things like translate languages, handle voice commands, or quickly summarize big chunks of text. 
It's the magic behind your smartphone's assistant and smarter search results, making it easier for us to chat with our gadgets.

Data: 

For our AI Project this semester, we set out to develop a classification algorithm that could take in the human readable text of a Tweet and produce a classification of that tweet as either positive or negative.
Our goal was to maximize the possible performance of this algorithm by exploring a broad set of possible ML and NLP approaches. As you can see, the layout of our data was text and simple binary labels. 

Naive Bayes: 

Our first and simplest model is a naive bayes bag of words classifier, we used this as the control for future model choices as it is relatively simple and explainable.
